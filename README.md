# SearchAlgorithmBenchmarks

A GUI application implemented with JavaFX that helps evaluate the runtime performance of different searching algorithms. Performance is evaluated based on the amount of comparisons to required to find a match.

## Features

Searching Algorithms:

- Sequential Search
- Binary Search

## Motivation

This project was implemented to complete a coding challenge from "Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Data Structures, 4th Edition".
